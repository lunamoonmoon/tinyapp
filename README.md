# TinyApp Project

**TinyApp** is a version of a URL shortener, it's a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs *(Ã  la bit.ly)*. A URL shortener helps to minimize the web page address into something that's easier to remember, track, and post in places with limited space.
